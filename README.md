# File-to-Video-Encoder
Lets you encode any file into a video and then read the data back from that video. For the scripts to work you need Python 3 and the following libraries: numpy, opencv, moviepy.

To encode a file run "encode.py" script and enter the name of the file (for example "examples/cat.jpg"). A file called "movie.mp4" will be generated. 

To read the encoded data from a movie run "read.py" script and enter the name of the movie. The decoded file will be placed in the same directory as the script.
